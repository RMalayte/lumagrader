# LumaGrader by Rax

A free RAW and JPEG photo editor that runs entirely in your browser, on phones and computers.

**▶ Open the app:** <https://lumagrader.app>
**📖 [User guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md)** · **☕ [Support on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/lumagrader)**

**Privacy:** your photos never leave your device. RAW decoding, editing and export all run in
the browser. There is no server, account, analytics or upload.

## Features

- **RAW + JPEG/PNG/WebP**: real sensor decoding for CR2, CR3, NEF, ARW, DNG, RAF, ORF, RW2,
  PEF and SRW, with the camera's embedded preview as a fallback
- **Light**: Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks, RGB and per-channel curves
- **Color**: white balance in Kelvin, Vibrance, Saturation, HSL, Color Grading wheels, profiles
- **Detail & effects**: Texture, Clarity, Dehaze, sharpening, noise reduction, vignette, grain
- **Optics & geometry**: distortion, lens vignetting, chromatic aberration removal, crop,
  straighten and rotate
- **Local edits**: Heal/Clone spots; Linear, Radial, Brush, Luminance and Color masks
- **Organise**: albums, star ratings, snapshots, presets (`.json` and `.xmp` import)
- **Save**: projects in the browser, `.lumagrader` project files on your device, crash recovery
- **Export**: JPEG/PNG/WebP, resize, watermark, batch export as ZIP
- **Works offline** after the first visit, and can be installed as an app

## Getting started (development)

Requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # local dev server (add -- --host to test on a phone on the same Wi-Fi)
npm run lint      # ESLint
npm run build     # production build → dist/
npm run preview   # serve the production build locally
```

`npm install` also copies the LibRaw WebAssembly files into `public/libraw/` (git-ignored).

## Deployment

Hosted on **Cloudflare Pages**, connected to this GitHub repo, at **lumagrader.app**.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Production branch | `main` |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `dist` |
| Node.js | 20 (from `.node-version`) |

Pushing to `main` deploys the live site. Pushing any other branch gives a preview deploy at
its own `*.pages.dev` address (HTTPS), handy for testing on a phone before merging.
GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) only lints and builds; it doesn't publish anything.

More detail on the architecture and release steps: [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Known limitations

- Projects and presets are stored in the browser they were saved in. Use **Save to device**
  for backups or to move work to another device.
- Full-size RAW export can take 10–15 s for a 24 MP file and needs a few hundred MB of memory.
- On phones, very large images are zoomed and exported at the largest size the device's
  graphics chip supports.
- Masks require WebGL.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

1. Fork the repo and create a branch (`git checkout -b fix/short-description`).
2. `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.
3. Before pushing, `npm run lint` and `npm run build` must pass. CI runs both on every push and PR.
4. Keep changes focused and use commit messages like `feat: …`, `fix: …` or `docs: …`.
5. Never commit secrets (`.env` files are git-ignored) or personal photos.
